# Emoji-Suggester

Emojis, a condensed form of language that can expresses emotions, have become an inescapable part of our online conversations. The emoji suggestion problem aims at predicting the emojis that are associated with a particular text. Models based on distant supervision that employ Bi-LSTMs and Transformer Networks are currently state-of-the-art for predicting emojis from a given text. On these lines, we implement a model that predicts and inserts emoji. Our model gives comparable performance to the state of the art baselines in the prediction task and also succeeds at placing the emoji at the intended position in the text.
